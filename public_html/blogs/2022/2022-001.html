            <p class="mb-5">A big long rant on Ubuntu, snap packages, and the mindset of fixing things that aren’t broken , all to push a poorly implemented idea under the guise of improvement.
                So, I just finished purging snapd from my system again on unbuntu 22.04. After having to  install a normal firefox version that actually works with the built-in gnome functionality such 
                as gnome-extensions. So now I really needed to vent about some of these design choices.             
                So, I wanna talk about Ubuntu version 22.04, Jammy Jellyfish. But more specifically, snap packages in Ubuntu and why they are a pain in the behind, back then and still.</p>
            
            <p class="mb-5">And let me preface this to first answer the question from the Ubuntu distro-haters: ‘Why are you on Ubuntu to begin with, it's a noob distro?’ First, I guess that’s for a few reasons. second, you're 
                wrong and i'll tell you why lol. I  genuinely like ubuntu's implementation of GNOME DE, how the nomenclature of debian commands just kinda make sense, and gaming on Ubuntu is in
                general much better supported now then on other distro’s with Valve's Steam. I also ran Arch Linux and Manjaro, but I was kind of tired of having the rolling releases on Arch. I do 
                think Ubuntu on average is too far behind the current versions, but I prefer having the stability of fixed releases to being on the bleeding edge at all times like Arch. The fact that most stuff
                from Arch Linux wiki works interchangably between on Ubuntu and Arch is nice as well.</p>
                
            <p class="mb-5">So for my gaming and working at home PC, Ubuntu is for now my distro of choice. I came to realise that the ubuntified gnome is actually better in look and in some ways functionality to me personally than
                the more 'pure' gnome look, that arch and maybe other distro's like to use. 
                In any case this, this rant is not about why I'm on Ubuntu. so, a small intro for the uninitiated: apt is the ‘Advanced Package Tool’ in Ubuntu/Debian.</p>
        
            <p class="mb-5">Apt was always the 'main' way of installing packages to the system. Actually, apt is the front-end functionality that talks to the underlying functionality dpkg. In practice, the 'apt install' command, creates a topological 
                list of all the packages and then calls the dpkg function in the most optimal order to install these packages. Of course, nothing in this world works perfectly, and neither does apt/dpkg. Especially in a situation where you need 2 different 
                versions of the exact same package it fails you. It could improve at those resolving dependency-conflicts a lot better, because there is no way to hold 2 different versions of the same package. 
                While the system is not perfect, it's strength lies in the fact that you can always see what exactly is wrong, which packages are having conflics, which packages are missing, or any other problems that would prevent your app from launching. 
                Snaps try their hand at fixing the issue of not being able to install 2 version of the same package by containerizing
                them from eacother.</p>            
            
            <p class="mb-5">The above 'solution' is actually also what mostly lead us into the direction of the problem with snap packages to begin with.
                So, let's talk about Snaps. Snaps are as u maybe know small virtual boxes/containers similar to flatpak, docker containers, etc. They install everything that is needed for the software to run inside their little box. The upside to this, is 
                obviously that you have all required packages with the correct versions for that app, without causing any underlying conflicts.
                You're not required to chase additional packages for the software that you already had to install, or run into a duplicate package issue with a version difference.</p>

            <p class="mb-5">And I can hear you ask; '..OK, so then what actually is the problem with them!?' Well, everything, lol. Everything in regards to using the snap, basically. And especially the idea that they get pushed so hard that they are now the default way in 
                Ubuntu to install software. Starting from Ubuntu 16.04 and up, the 'default' way to install software is through the software center, if you're not aware of the fact that you could be using .deb files from the commandline as an inexperienced user you could 
                be having a severly downgraded first time experience using ubuntu. The Ubuntu 'Software center' is in itself just a snapd skin. Any software you install through the software center now gets installed as a snap at all times. And you might be thinking, ok, so why are snaps such a bad thing? They are simply a highly inferior design to what existed already, and that's also giving credit to the solid
                foundation that exists in dpkg, and not just a cheap shot at snaps.</p>

            <p class="mb-5">Snaps actually just don't work as good as canonical wants them to work, period. And certainly not compared to any other app that has an regular .deb version to install from. There are some select snaps that do work well, but it’s honestly the small minority.
                The whole idea that they want to make it more easy to install software in Ubuntu for end users, or with conflicting libraries is great I think. But when critical features of the software don’t work because of the fact that you sandboxed them, or the way you install them 
                from the software center is actually so incredibly buggy, it kind of defeats it’s own entire point.</p>

            <p class="mb-5">The first major issue is that snaps often don't install correctly, and they are poorly/not maintaned in a lot of cases. in some cases in the past, even highly insecure or malicious. 
                So the quality control of packages, something that used to be important in Ubuntu, snapd just seems to have throw away with this entire design philosphy. Canonical can no longer control 
                what devs do with snaps, so Microsoft just leaves Skype totally broken in the snap store for over a year, people place crypto miners in their own snap, etc. Second major issue is that for 
                the snaps that are sort of maintaned, sometimes they install and then just don't run properly for you. With that I mean important things, like the app is just a white screen that does notihng. 
                With dpkg during an install, or heck, even just running an app on the commandline, gives you lots of information on how to fix it. And with the coming of snap packages in the event they don't 
                end up working right away, you usually spend so long fixing them also that you might as well have dedicated all that time to install the .deb variant in the first place. The third major issue,
                is that Snaps are on average like 30% slower to load up compared to the .deb variant when you do actually get them installed. Starting Firefox on 22.04 which is now a default snap feels like 
                you can go get a coffee every time you open a new window. Same for lots of other apps. They are also always far larger in file size because they hold duplicate packages that cannot be tracked
                by apt, which fixes one problem, and adds the fact that you might also install countless of other packages in duplicate. Granted, they're not very big packages, but Ubuntu that can run on way small 
                footprints then Windows again does not gain anything from these design choices.</p>

                <p class="mb-5">Snaps actually just don't work as good as canonical wants them to work, period. And certainly not compared to any other app that has an regular .deb version to install from. There are some select snaps that do work well, but it’s honestly the small minority.
                The whole idea that they want to make it more easy to install software in Ubuntu for end users, or with conflicting libraries is great I think. But when critical features of the software don’t work because of the fact that you sandboxed them, or the way you install them 
                from the software center is actually so incredibly buggy, it kind of defeats it’s own entire point.</p>

                <p class="mb-5">The fourth and one of the most serious problem I think is the permissions for Snaps (even after setting them in the permissions panel or with the commandline) are always wonky, or more wonky than the .deb for sure.
                Why would normal users want their Firefox downloads or Skype downloads to go into /tmp by default instead of the normal Downloads folder. Or why would normal end users want audacity not be able to control any
                audio devices without tweaking? And I can hear people say: hurr durr, why don't you just fix the bad permissions of the snap then?
                And my answer is, why are snaps made and thought of as to be convenient, when the whole idea of click and launch clearly does not work very well on linux anyway, so surrendering to the fact we're gonna have to bust 
                out the terminal would be 100% a better solution in my humble opinion.
                Canonical had everyone make a little sandbox, so people can easily install it, but then after this 'simple' install that might not even work, they need to troubleshoot all the apps core features, because it can't 
                actually do anything by default without fixing a bunch of stuff right away. The Linux community but actually Canonical devs in general need to start understanding their target audiences more. Stop trying to please 
                both of the big crowd at the same time, because this is how it feels all of the time, it seems you have no idea who ends up using your OS.
                In my opinion, none of this would be an issue anyways, if snapd was just a nice little feature for boomers who are still on Ubuntu and really need it stil. But not THE way and soon the ONLY way to install everything 
                for every single IT professional, developer, at all times from now and forever, and otherwise a thousand Bionic Beavers will strike your knee if you don't use our Snaps.</p>

                <p class="mb-5">Why does it have to be like that Canonical, why you have to do us like that?
                Snap is honestly OK if you really don't have any other alternative, because the developers for the software that you like to use hold some sadistic grudge to only develop a snap and not make a simple deb package or be able to compile from source, or something, 
                but if I have a choice, hell no.I am so confused who Ubuntu is catering their OS towards in actuality. I feel like it's new users most of the time, but when you look at all the stuff not included in even the latest version in the current computer landscape it's 
                kind of insane. Stuff I want to mention is no volume controls, no ability to select audio interfaces/devices, no out of the box hybernation and sleep functionality, no wifi channel reload button, I can go on for a while. One of my biggest pet peeves with it is when
                you have the brand new ubuntu version installed and did nothing yet, often times simply right clicking on a certain app you want to uninstall that came default does not work, it either redirects you to the snap store and it can't find the app, or the link does not work 
                at all. And you can 100% forget about being able to uninstall without a commandline, so again what is the point of this GUI feature really?</p>

                <p class="mb-5">You are developing a Linux operating system, which is on average already like what? The market share of 0.3% of this entire planets desktop computer users, if you look at how many people are on Windows/Mac? That already implies that most normal end users are not Running Ubuntu anyways.
                And you make these changes to, it seems accommodate new users to install software? But you actually don’t see that Linux itself is a very convoluted OS to almost everyone that has no experience with using it, and actually needs to learn about the commandline anyways. 
                Especially when something breaks with a snap package, which is every time you install them lol. 
                And I'm not even going to start on the smaller stuff such as breaking the entire principle of the GNOME system theme designs, or extension. Snaps don't adhere to it, additional steps are required all the time, when again this was something that was one of the biggest selling points of Ubuntu and 
                GNOME at the same time, and the snap was supposed to SAVE us work remember?</p>

                <p class="mb-5">Why are we pretending that the people that use Ubuntu in a serious capacity are the same people that asked for snaps? Or do you not care about any advanced users and only beginning users?
                It seems that a lot of the stuff mentioned above could be a lot better for people who you claim to also need snaps, because it's clearly not for any of the computer scients, web- or software developers, security researchers, etc. etc. on Linux.
                Otherwise I think you'd take into consideration stuff like chaning the firefox application to a snap only. And even worse, having it auto-reinstall the snap while you were using apt commands. That was what made me really dislike this last version.</p>

                <p class="mb-5">Since I don't like to only complain and also like to think about solutions, if you do the same thing that you did for the snap store, but now build it around apt and dpkg instead, you could do the same thing you want to do but better.
                An image that comes close to it in my head is the update wndow for ubuntu system software-updates, that seems to have a similar GUI-shell that werks perfect for certain situations with dpkg, just never for any front-end app store for whatever reason that might be.
                Fix that issue and you have what you tried to find in the snap store all this time, and the apps would actually work after you installed them. Then we could still improve snaps over time for them to be less shit, but they needed so much work before they became the default,
                and I will never understand why it was implemented as a main component so fast. i sincerely hoping this direction will be admitted for the mistake that it is, and we can all return to using dpkg like good old boys and girls without a care in the world.</p>

                <p class="mb-5">
                    At least for the sake of my sanity, let firefox be the only app you sneak into dpkg, let dpkg be our last remaining beacon of hope and sanity in these trying times.
                    With that said, until that time is there that snap is unescapable or finally gone, I suggest to you all try;
                    >sudo snap list
                    >snap remove gtk-common-themes
                    >snap remove everything else
                    >snap remove snap-store
                    >snap remove core18
                    >snap remove core
                    >apt remove snapd
                    >apt purge snapd  
                    and start using deb's instead. Cheers.</p>
